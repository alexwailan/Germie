# Germie


## Etymology
Germination is the development of a plant from a seed or spore. Consider your multi-fasta alignment as a seed and this program will grow you a tree. Australians love to shorten phrases e.g Onya mate! is short of Good on you/ya friend!. Thus 'Germie' is short for Germination.
